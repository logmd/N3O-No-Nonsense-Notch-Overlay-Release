# External Tools - Addon where external tools can be added. Typical use for this will be binaries.

## Instructions:
* Place arm/arm64/x86/x64 compiled binaries into their respective folders inside tools directory and they will be loaded/added to path automatically so you can call them like any other binary (no need to specify path)
* Place other cpu architecture independent tools into the other folder and MMT-Ex will load them into PATH/alias them automatically so you can call them like any other binary (no need to specify path)

## Included Binaries/Credits:
* sesearch by [xmikos @Github ](https://github.com/xmikos/setools-android)
* xmlstarlet compiled by [james34602 @Github](https://github.com/james34602)
