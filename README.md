# No Nonsense Notch Overlay Mod (N3O Mod)

This mod is intended for oneplus devices with a holepunch cutout.

## What does it do

- It allows apps to span behind the camera in landscape
- It maintaining the contents of your status bar in portrait respecting the cameras position

## Mod Presets

- Oneplus 
  - 8 Pro QHD+ (cant get around the resolution change atm)
  - 8, 8 Pro FHD+, 8T 
- Google 
  - Pixel 5

## Customisation

- first installation creates 3 files `custom1.txt` `custom2.txt` and `custom3.txt` inside the folder `/sdcard/com.logmd.n3o/`
- edit either file and replace with desired number of pixels for your custom cutout.. e.g. edit `custom1.txt` with root explorer, make the value `125` and save
- reinstall the module then reboot :)

## Compatibility

### Android 11
Should work on AOSP based android 11

### Android 10
HAS ISSUES!
- some bootloops/sysui crash (TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK)
- please test a backup method of removing magisk or restoring via adb before trying

## How does it work

Within each devices framework code, there are xml values for "drawing" the cutout location using svg draw paths.
now what i currently do is remove the camera cutout portion but leave a line of 1px at the top of the screen above the camera

e.g. for the 8T

```
M -407 68.5 A 34 34 0 0 1 -475 68.5 A 34 34 0 0 1 -407 68.5 Z M -475,0 L -407,0 Z M -540,0 L -540,102.5 Z
```

```
M -475 1 L -407 1 Z M -540 0 L -540 0 Z
```
